There will not be a severe recession this year or next, and after a brief dip towards September markets will be higher because the end of the cycle is not until 2026-2027. After that the shit is really going to hit the fan"

"I might try again in the future, but it seems as of now the market call is a bit early as the recession continues to push out in time. Also, I would like a few more specific target investments within sectors, which may come in the future I recognize when the market outlook stabilizes. I do very much appreciate the depth of analysis and the positioning. Segmenting between strategic and tactical reports is really helpful."

"I followed your inaccurate call on the market and have suffered. Your presentations seemed logical, but have been incorrect this year. I cannot afford to continue to follow your advice. Maybe it's a result of an anomaly such as the recent surge due to AI? But, your call on employment has been incorrect and with the report this week there are not any indications you will be correct this year. If the market is priced at 3-6 months into the future, a recession is NOT in the cards for 2023!"

Maybe it's in the trading room, but there is no free trial for that. After I have learned more about trading, using trendlines & macd in technical analysis feels bit silly, there is no edge. Furthermore, some of the trade ideas (like shorting XLK) are not available on my location (Finland). I'll continue to follow the free youtube channel. What I might be interested in future is to learn macroeconomics and relationships between differnet assets and such theories;maybe there could a lesson section in the site for those who want to learn make their own analysis."
